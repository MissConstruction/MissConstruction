hey so, please be careful of this person, they ENTIRELY copied my friend's partner's Nam-Gyu skin, and this person hid both my friend and their partner. Be careful, since they might also copy someone else's skin, i won't take this down unless the person won't delete the copied skin, if the person blocks me, it'll stay on either way lol . . . are you really THAT uncreative that you have to copy someone else's skin? Make a skin eith YOUR own idea and not someone else's. You're honestly being a coward, you think anyone would believe your 'friend's" or more likely YOUR message on my ata, then you're absolutely wrong. All bark and no bite, obviously you'd be rude to my friend on dms, calling their style 'trash' meanwhile you don't even have one lmao. Also fym you gave up after a month??? what you said sounds all FAKE. Obviously not everyone's gonna be a god at making skins under just a month. "i know how to get out of these situations" digital footprint exists btw... and what do you do? change your whole identity??? honestly PATHETIC. No wonder you pretended to be your nonexistent friend and wrotw that on my ata.. ^_^

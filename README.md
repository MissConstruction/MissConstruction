hey so, please be careful of this person, they ENTIRELY copied my friend's partner's Nam-Gyu skin, and this person hid both my friend and their partner. Be careful, since they might also copy someone else's skin, i won't take this down unless the person won't delete the copied skin, either way if the person blocks me, it'll stay on either way lol . . . are you really THAT uncreative that you have to copy someone else's skin? Make a skin eith YOUR own idea and not someone else's.

I like reading, drawing, painting, watching movies (thriller, horror etc)  and crafting alot (sleeping too) !!![6folu8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/725a4902-e763-407d-8b17-6a469362b9df)

i also misspell ALOT. It's almost always because i type TOO quickly, i'm sometimes really unserious, but when it comes to serious topics (vents, other problems), i'll get serious too

If i'm quiet, it doesn't mean i'm bored of you/hate you, i just don't know what to say at times, but as we get close, the moe and more talkative i get!! I also get attached really easily, so i'm really sorry if i get annoying ! i REALLY love drawing / making skins for my friends!! i really love seeing them happy <3 i also ADORE making ocs together with oomfs LIKE HELL YEAH?????? I'LL INSTANTLY AGREE, NO NEED TO EVEN ASK!!! (╹ڡ╹ )


 I'm honestly really feeling unwell nowadays, because of a friendship problem, so i'll be upset most of the time （；´д｀）ゞ i TRULY miss the person, even if i was the one who left for my own reasons. I still feel REALLY guilty, and regret everything, but i know i can't make things back to the same (。﹏。*)

If you ever wanna vent to be, i'll warn you because i'm a terrible comforter. I'll still try my best comforting you though ^_^ Also, i'll honestly don't know how to comfort at all when it comes to family problems. (i haven't really exprienced any in my life, so i'll be really clueless on how to comfort by it, especially if it's father issues, i'm sorry （＞人＜；）

Basic DNI criteria.

Nazis and supporters of Nazis

Ppl who downplay ANY serious / problematic topics in general

ANY kind of motherless jokes. Seriously, those really hurt me and i'll instantly block you.

Zoophilles (ew.) 

Ppl who make fun of SA or SH, neither of them are funny.

![xv5l5o](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72734c7-6c92-41b3-ab2d-e6732f23d14a)
People who force their ships on people. 

srsly DNI if you tell people to kts over ships. ( DW berryfunny, Christmasflower shippers yall are on thin ice.. i'm sorry but i've had terrible expriences with some of you) 

Ryker x Leon (8:11) shippers. Do i even have to explain? Ryker sees Leon as their father figure, not some kind of lover. Leon also sees Ryker as his own son/child

Vittorino x Ryker (8:11 AGAIN) Sigh... victim x abuser.
